//! Read-time detection of an *attention-required* run (design.md §2.5 / A5,
//! issue `attention-required-run-surface`).
//!
//! An attention-required run is the design's deliberate "finished but skipped
//! `run merge`" case: the worker process exited **cleanly** (the launcher shim
//! recorded a `worker.exited` with `code == 0` and no signal) yet the node is
//! still **non-terminal** — no `explicit-merge` transition ever landed, so the
//! typed outcome table (§2.6) leaves it as
//! [`LiveVerdict::AttentionRequired`](crate::supervise::outcome::LiveVerdict::AttentionRequired) and
//! the supervisor does nothing further. Without this surface such a run sits
//! `pending`/`running` forever: `run wait` would block the whole timeout, and the
//! PO-review cadence that is supposed to discover the jam never sees it.
//!
//! Crucially this is **not a terminal state** and this module **never mutates**
//! anything — like its sibling [`crate::run::stalled`], it is a *computed*
//! read-time hint over a durable told fact (`Node::worker_exit`) plus the node's
//! current status. Terminalizing the run here would defeat the whole point: the
//! manual-finish path (§2.2 — drive `run merge` from the worktree, or
//! `run cancel`) needs the run left exactly where it is, work preserved.
//!
//! ## Why this is a durable fact, not a race
//!
//! The shim records `worker.exited` only **after** `wait()` on the agent process
//! returns — i.e. after the agent has exited. The *original* worker cannot go on
//! to run `run merge` after its exit is recorded, so at the moment of detection a
//! clean-exit-and-no-merge observation is unambiguous and needs no grace window
//! (unlike the orphaned-supervisor shape, whose "is it just restarting?"
//! ambiguity forces one). The computed *hint* is nonetheless not durable: the
//! whole point of the surface is that a human or a re-driven agent then runs
//! `run merge` (or `run cancel`), which drives the node terminal and clears the
//! hint. So "the fact is stable" means "the exited process can't itself merge",
//! not "the run stays attention-required forever".
//!
//! ## Precedence over the stall shapes
//!
//! Attention-required is checked **before** the [`crate::run::stalled`] verdicts.
//! A worker that exited cleanly and whose supervisor *also* later died would
//! otherwise match `orphaned` (dead supervisor, ≥1 node, idle) — but the correct
//! remediation is the manual finish (`run merge` from the worktree), NOT
//! `run reattach` (reviving the supervisor just re-observes the same clean exit
//! and does nothing). The told clean-exit fact is the more specific truth, so it
//! wins.
