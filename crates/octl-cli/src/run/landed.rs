//! The rebase-robust `landed` signal surfaced by `run wait` / `run show`.
//!
//! ## Why this exists (issue `landing-signal-reliable-after-rebase`)
//!
//! The `worktree-spinoff` / `stint` skills used to tell the caller to confirm a
//! landing *from git* with
//!
//! ```text
//! git merge-base --is-ancestor <worker-branch> <target>
//! ```
//!
//! That check is a **false-negative trap in exactly the environment `/stint`
//! targets** — a heavy-parallel repo where other sessions push to `origin/main`
//! continuously, forcing the conductor to `git rebase origin/main` its local
//! `main` repeatedly during a round. After such a rebase:
//!
//! - the worker's merge commit is **replayed under a new hash** on the rebased
//!   local `main`;
//! - the worker **branch ref** still points at its **pre-rebase** hash;
//! - `git merge-base --is-ancestor <branch> main` then returns **false** even
//!   though the worker's *content* is fully merged.
//!
//! The conductor concludes "the worker died / didn't land" and nearly takes a
//! destructive recovery action. Observed firing twice in one real session.
//!
//! ## The fix: patch-id equivalence + ancestry, not branch-ref ancestry alone
//!
//! [`git_verify_landed`] confirms a landing by **content**, in two rungs so it is
//! sound for every way this codebase integrates a branch (a rebase-then-`--ff-only`
//! merge — see `run merge`'s `merge.sh`):
//!
//! 1. **Patch-id equivalence (`git cherry`).** `git -C <repo> cherry <source>
//!    <branch> <base>` reports each of the branch's own commits as `-` (a
//!    patch-equivalent commit exists in the target) or `+` (none does). Patch-id
//!    is stable across a rebase — a replayed commit keeps its patch-id under a new
//!    hash — so a landing stays confirmed after the caller rebases their local
//!    target. If every commit is `-`, landed. (Verified: even immediately after a
//!    rebase-then-ff merge, `--is-ancestor` reads false while `cherry` reads `-`.)
//! 2. **Ancestry safety net (`merge-base --is-ancestor`).** Only consulted when
//!    rung 1 did not already confirm (a `+` line, or an empty `base..branch` range
//!    — e.g. `base_sha` absent). If the branch tip is literally reachable from the
//!    target *and* the branch advanced past its fork point, it landed. This rung
//!    catches a fast-forward / plain-merge landing whose commits `cherry` could not
//!    range over, and it is only reached AFTER rung 1, so it can never reintroduce
//!    the rebase false negative (the rebase case is already `-` at rung 1). The
//!    advanced-past-`base` guard rejects a never-committed or rewound branch, which
//!    is trivially an ancestor yet merged nothing.
//!
//! A `+` line that ancestry also can't rescue is a **genuine** unlanded commit —
//! reported as `landed: false, git-verified` (authoritative: git's live view wins
//! over a stale marker, so a worker that committed more after its merge is not
//! silently counted as fully landed).
//!
//! When neither rung can run — the branch ref was already torn down by the
//! supervisor, no `source_repo`/`branch` was recorded, or git errors — the signal
//! falls back to the durable **report marker**: a confirmed `run merge` terminal
//! `node.report` (a typed `ReportOrigin::RunMerge` origin, or — for a legacy
//! report with no origin field — `via: "explicit-merge"`; issue
//! `retire-via-string`) — the only success-completion marker in the thin model.
//! That marker is the recorded
//! fact that the merge completed; it was correct in the session where the ancestry
//! check lied, and it is the real post-teardown case (the branch ref is force-
//! deleted after a confirmed merge, so only the marker remains).
//!
//! `landed` means **integrated into the target's history** (patch-present or
//! reachable), NOT "the expected tree is currently checked out": a later commit on
//! the target that reverts the work is a separate event this flag does not model.
//!
//! The caller reads one boolean (`landed`) plus a `landed_method`
//! (`git-verified` | `report-marker` | `unverified`) that says how the verdict
//! was reached, and never has to run `merge-base --is-ancestor` by hand.
