//! `node` subcommand — read (`list`, `show`) + agent self-report (`report`).
//!
//! Mirrors the noun-module pattern set by `run/`: one file per verb,
//! shared types here, single `dispatch` entry point called from
//! `cli.rs`. The `report` verb is a domain verb (design.md §2.0, §2.2)
//! — it's the agent's structured-report sink and accepts the §7.3
//! payload schema directly rather than going through `event create`.
