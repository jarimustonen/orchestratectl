//! Spawn a detached `taskfleet supervise <run-id>` process and
//! wait briefly for its PID file to appear.
//!
//! Shared by `run create` (top-level), `run reattach`, and the parent
//! supervisor's child-spawn loop. All three funnel through the same
//! [`detached_supervise_command`] + [`spawn_and_reap`] pair so the process
//! detachment hardening (the double-fork below) lives in exactly one place.
//!
//! # Why double-fork
//!
//! A supervisor must outlive both the terminal that launched it and the
//! process that spawned it, and must never linger as a zombie. The naive
//! `Command::spawn` leaves the child in the spawner's session/process group
//! (so closing the terminal `SIGHUP`s every supervisor) and as a direct
//! child (so an exited supervisor becomes a zombie until the spawner
//! `wait()`s it — and `kill(pid, 0)` reports a zombie as *alive*, corrupting
//! the PID-staleness check).
//!
//! The fix is a classic double-fork, run inside `pre_exec` (after `fork`,
//! before `exec`):
//!   1. `setsid()` — the child leads a new session with no controlling
//!      terminal, so a terminal `SIGHUP` can never reach it.
//!   2. `fork()` again — the intermediate exits *immediately* (`_exit`,
//!      bypassing Rust destructors), so the grandchild is orphaned and
//!      reparented to init (pid 1). Init reaps the grandchild when it
//!      eventually exits, so no zombie ever accrues on our side.
//!
//! The spawner then `wait()`s the short-lived intermediate (it has already
//! `_exit`ed, so the wait returns at once) to reap *it*. Net: nothing the
//! spawner owns can become a zombie, and the real supervisor is fully
//! detached.
//!
//! Because this runs in `pre_exec` — before the supervisor binary's
//! `main`/tracing-subscriber ever initialize — there is no worker thread to
//! be orphaned by the intermediate's exit (a real hazard if you double-fork
//! *after* the runtime starts). The grandchild builds its tracing stack
//! fresh after `exec`.
//!
//! One consequence: the PID `Command::spawn` returns is the intermediate's,
//! not the grandchild's. The authoritative supervisor PID is the one the
//! supervisor writes into its own `supervisor.pid` during
//! [`crate::supervise::pid_file::claim_pid_atomic`]; lenient callers that need
//! it read it back from that file (see [`await_recorded_pid`]).
//!
//! # Confirming boot — readiness pipe vs. pid-file poll
//!
//! `run create` cannot record a run as started until it knows the supervisor
//! booted. It confirms that with a [readiness pipe](crate::run::supervisor_readiness)
//! threaded through the double-fork: the grandchild writes a readiness byte
//! carrying its pid AFTER `claim_pid_atomic` + init, and [`spawn_for_run`]
//! blocks reading it (a byte → confirmed; EOF → the supervisor died during
//! init; a structured error → the real reason). This has no timeout and no
//! orphan window — replacing the old bounded `supervisor.pid` poll that
//! false-failed a slow-but-healthy boot into `supervisor_spawn_failed` while
//! the grandchild kept running (issue `supervisor-confirm-readiness-pipe`).
//! The lenient callers (`run reattach`, child-spawn) do NOT confirm via the
//! pipe; they read `supervisor.pid` directly ([`await_recorded_pid`] /
//! [`read_live_recorded_pid`]) and tolerate "not yet confirmed".
