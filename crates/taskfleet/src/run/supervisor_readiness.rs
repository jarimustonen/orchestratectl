//! Daemonization **readiness pipe** for confirming a detached supervisor booted.
//!
//! `run create` must learn — without an arbitrary timeout — whether the
//! supervisor it double-forks (see [`crate::run::supervisor_spawn`]) actually
//! came up. The old mechanism polled `supervisor.pid` for a bounded window
//! (`PID_FILE_WAIT`); a healthy-but-slow boot under load could exceed the
//! deadline and be false-failed into `supervisor_spawn_failed` while the
//! grandchild kept running — an orphan supervising a run the caller was told
//! failed (issue `supervisor-confirm-readiness-pipe`, review finding F4b).
//!
//! The fix is the classic UNIX readiness pipe threaded through the double-fork:
//!
//! 1. The parent ([`ReadinessPipe::new`]) creates a pipe with `FD_CLOEXEC` on
//!    **both** ends (so a concurrent `exec` on another thread cannot leak the
//!    write end and suppress EOF). CLOEXEC on the write end is cleared only
//!    inside the forked child's `pre_exec`, right before `exec`, so exactly the
//!    intended grandchild inherits it. The parent passes the write-end fd number
//!    to the child via `OCTL_READINESS_FD` in the child's environment.
//! 2. The grandchild (the real supervisor) takes ownership of that inherited fd
//!    ([`ReadinessReporter::from_env`], validating it is an open pipe above
//!    stdio) and, **after** `claim_pid_atomic` + boot init, writes a one-line
//!    readiness message and closes the fd ([`ReadinessReporter::ready`] /
//!    [`ReadinessReporter::error`]).
//! 3. The parent closes its own copy of the write end
//!    ([`ReadinessPipe::close_write`]) — so it is not itself a writer — and reads
//!    one framed line in [`ReadinessPipe::await_ready`], bounded by a generous
//!    backstop deadline:
//!    - a `ready` line → the supervisor confirmed boot (carries its pid);
//!    - EOF with no message → every write-end copy closed without a signal, so
//!      the supervisor **died during init** (fate-sharing);
//!    - an `error` line → the supervisor articulated a real boot failure;
//!    - a truncated/garbled message → treated as a boot failure, never a hang;
//!    - the deadline elapses → the supervisor is **wedged** (alive, not
//!      progressing) → [`Readiness::Timeout`].
//!
//! Fate-sharing is exact: EOF arrives only once **all** write-end copies
//! (parent, double-fork intermediate, grandchild) are closed. The parent must
//! therefore [`close_write`](ReadinessPipe::close_write) before reading, and the
//! grandchild closes its copy as soon as it has written (or when it exits
//! without writing). Reading one newline-framed line — rather than to EOF — means
//! a complete `ready` is honored even if some stray duplicate of the write end
//! lingers open; confirmation never waits on every descriptor closing.
//!
//! # Why a generous backstop deadline (not the old 15s poll)
//!
//! EOF detects *death*, not a *wedge*. `claim_pid_atomic` takes the run flock
//! with a **blocking** `flock` (taskfleet-core `lock.rs`), so a supervisor stuck
//! behind a dead lock-holder — or wedged on NFS/a failed mount during init —
//! never writes AND never closes the write end, and a purely unbounded read
//! would hang `run create` forever. [`await_ready`](ReadinessPipe::await_ready)
//! therefore polls the read end with a **generous** deadline (default 120s,
//! `OCTL_READY_WAIT_MS`) that acts as a wedge circuit-breaker, ~8× the old
//! bounded poll so it never false-fails a merely slow-but-healthy boot. The
//! confirmation itself is still edge-triggered (a byte or EOF, whichever comes
//! first) — the deadline only bounds a genuine hang.
//!
//! # Wire format
//!
//! One newline-terminated line, tag byte first. The frame is **strict**: a
//! ready signal is accepted only as `R<digits>\n` in full, so a write truncated
//! by a crash (missing the terminator, or trailing garbage) is classified
//! `Malformed` — never a false `Ready` carrying a truncated pid.
//!   - ready:  `R<pid>\n`               (`pid` decimal, the supervisor's own pid)
//!   - error:  `E<code>\t<message>\n`   (a structured boot-failure reason)
