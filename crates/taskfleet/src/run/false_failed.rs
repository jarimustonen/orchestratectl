//! Read-time detection of a *suspected false-failed* run — a `failed` run whose
//! worker content is git-verified in source, but which no `run merge`
//! transaction recorded (issue `raw-git-selfmerge-false-failed`, epic
//! `lifecycle-architecture-review`).
//!
//! ## The thin-model tradeoff this surfaces
//!
//! Under the thin supervisor, `run merge` is the ONLY success truth (invariant 6
//! / design §2.1b): it records a `merge.started` transaction, stamps a typed
//! [`ReportOrigin::RunMerge`](taskfleet_core::ReportOrigin) terminal report, and is the
//! only path the recovery machinery can complete. An agent that instead
//! **hand-merges its branch into source with raw git** (`git checkout main &&
//! git merge wt/...`) and then dies leaves NO merge transaction and NO typed
//! merge origin. The crash backstop (design §2.1a) then confirms the worker gone,
//! finds no merge, and synthesizes a `failed` report — even though the worker's
//! content is already integrated into source.
//!
//! This is **not data loss**: the teardown gate (invariant 5) preserves the
//! branch AND worktree on every non-explicit-merge terminal, so the work is
//! exactly where a human left it. It is an **observability tradeoff** — a run
//! reads `failed` while its content is, in fact, in source.
//!
//! ## What this module does — and deliberately does NOT do
//!
//! It is a pure, read-time, **non-mutating** hint (like its siblings
//! [`crate::run::attention`] / [`crate::run::stalled`]) computed by `run show`.
//! It **never terminalizes the run to `done`** and never re-classifies the
//! outcome. Auto-flipping a `failed` run to `done` off a branch-content
//! heuristic is exactly the inference the thin model deletes (the removed
//! git-reconcile-implies-done probe, invariant 7) — resurrecting it would let a
//! forged/coincidental branch state fake a success. So this surfaces a
//! **suspicion + remediation**, not a verdict: the human runs
//! [`run salvage`](crate::run::salvage) — which drives the skipped merge through
//! the real `run merge` machinery (recording the transaction, the typed origin,
//! the CAS-guarded fast-forward), idempotently against the already-integrated
//! content — to record the merge and terminalize the run to `done` honestly.
//!
//! ## The exact firing signature
//!
//! [`is_false_failed_suspected`] fires only when ALL of:
//!
//! - the run's status is `Failed` — a settled negative terminal. A live/pending
//!   run is `attention`/`stall` territory, and a `done`/`cancelled` run has no
//!   false-failed to suspect.
//! - `landed` is `true` **and** its method is
//!   [`LandedMethod::GitVerified`]
//!   — git's *live, authoritative* view says every branch commit is integrated
//!   into the current source tip (patch-id equivalence, rebase-robust). A
//!   `report-marker` landing is deliberately EXCLUDED: that marker only exists on
//!   a confirmed `run merge`, which would have rolled the run to `done`, not
//!   `failed` — so seeing it on a `failed` run would mean a corrupt projection,
//!   not a raw-git self-merge. Requiring `git-verified` means the suspicion rests
//!   on git ground truth, never on a report field.
//! - the terminal report is NOT a confirmed `run merge` (no typed `RunMerge`
//!   origin / legacy `via: "explicit-merge"`). A recorded merge is the honest
//!   `done` path; its absence beside git-verified-landed content is the whole
//!   tell.
//! - a **fork-point (`base_sha`) is recorded** for the node. This is the stricter
//!   burden of proof this consumer demands over the bare `landed` signal (llm
//!   review consensus, gemini + deepseek): without a `base_sha`,
//!   [`crate::run::landed`]'s ancestry safety net cannot tell a genuine landing
//!   from a **never-advanced branch that merged nothing** — a branch trivially an
//!   ancestor of source with zero commits reads `landed: true, git-verified` under
//!   the missing-base fallback (`branch_advanced_past_base` returns `true` when
//!   `base` is `None`). Firing on that would tell a user to `run salvage` a branch
//!   with no work. Every normal spinoff records `base_sha` at `node.created`, so
//!   requiring it suppresses only the ambiguous legacy/corrupt no-fork-point case
//!   — a deliberately conservative false-negative (never a false positive).
//!
//! Every branch of that AND is load-bearing: drop the git-verified requirement
//! and a stale marker could fire it; drop the not-a-merge requirement and an
//! honest `done` run (mis-statused) could; drop the `Failed` gate and a
//! still-running raw-git-merger (not yet dead) would false-flag before the human
//! could even act; drop the `base_sha` requirement and a never-advanced branch
//! that merged nothing would falsely read as landed.
//!
//! ## Accepted blind spots (false negatives, never false positives)
//!
//! The signal rests on git's *history* view of the recorded worker branch, so it
//! deliberately does NOT fire — but also never mis-fires — in these shapes:
//!
//! - **Single-worker only.** `run show` gates this on `node_count == 1` (mirroring
//!   [`crate::run::attention`]): the reporting node is `n-0001`, so for a
//!   multi-node fan-out a *child* worker that raw-selfmerged then died is NOT
//!   surfaced (its `n-0001` may be a driver). Per-node false-failed is the
//!   delegated `per-node-run` follow-up.
//! - **Squash merges.** A `git merge --squash` collapses the branch's commits into
//!   one new patch-id, so `git cherry` sees `+` and ancestry is false — `landed`
//!   reads false and the hint stays silent. The content IS in source but git
//!   cannot prove the *branch's* commits landed.
//! - **Post-merge extra commits.** If the worker raw-merged then committed MORE on
//!   the branch before dying, `git cherry` sees a `+` for the extra commit and
//!   `landed` reads false — the run's *earlier* work is in source but the branch
//!   is no longer fully integrated, so the hint stays silent.
//!
//! In every case a false negative is strictly safer than falsely telling a user
//! their work is already merged.
