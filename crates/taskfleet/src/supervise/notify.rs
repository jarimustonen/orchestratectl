//! Terminal-completion notification hook (`run create --notify <cmd>`).
//!
//! When a run reaches a terminal state (`done | failed | cancelled`) the
//! supervisor runs the caller-registered command exactly once, BEFORE the
//! teardown path removes the worktree/window/branch. This is the push signal
//! a spawning session needs so it can learn of completion without polling
//! (issue `no-completion-notification-to-parent`): the parent registers e.g.
//! a line-append to a file its harness watches, a `terminal-notifier` /
//! `notify-send` desktop toast, or a FIFO write.
//!
//! ## At-least-once
//!
//! Firing is deduped on a durable `run.notified` marker event carrying the
//! deterministic idempotency key `supervisor-notify:<run-id>`. Under one
//! exclusive-lock critical section the supervisor scans for the marker; if it
//! is absent it spawns the command FIRST and records the marker only AFTER.
//! So a crash in the window between the spawn and the marker append leaves no
//! marker, and the next supervisor (restart / reattach) re-fires — a duplicate
//! notification. This is the owner's deliberate call (2026-07-24): a missed
//! completion signal defeats the whole feature, so "tell twice" beats "miss
//! it". In the common no-crash case the marker is recorded, so a later tick or
//! a fresh supervisor dedups to exactly one fire; duplicates arise only from an
//! actual crash between spawn and marker.
//!
//! ## Non-blocking
//!
//! The command runs via `sh -c` and the supervisor never `wait`s on it inline,
//! so a slow or hung hook can never wedge the single-threaded supervisor tick.
//! A dedicated reaper thread blocks on the child so a fast hook is collected
//! promptly rather than lingering as a zombie until the supervisor exits (which
//! is unbounded for a cancelled parent that keeps ticking until its children
//! settle).
